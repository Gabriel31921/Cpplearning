**Problem:**

Write a program that asks the user to enter their full name and their age. 
As output, tell the user the sum of their age and the number of characters in their name.
For simplicity, count any spaces in the name as a character.

**Solution:**

It's a simple exercise, introductory to working with std::string,
std::string::length() or std::ssize() and std::getline().

First we write a function that gets a string as an input from the user,
then we ask the use for his age, this is a double, 
and finally, we sum both values.
