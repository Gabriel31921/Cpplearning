**Problem:**

Update the previous solution to the Hi-Lo game to handle invalid guesses (e.g. ‘x’), 
out of bounds guesses, 
or valid guesses that have extraneous characters (e.g. 43x). 
Also handle the user entering extra characters when the game asks them whether they want to play again.

**Solution:**

This one seems simple, but it is not, it's difficulty depends on how well did you code it the first time.
I have had to re-code everything from scratch, because I couldn't test everything.
I made the code more granular, wrote clearer functions, and made sure there was no way to mess it up for the user.
