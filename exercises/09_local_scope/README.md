**Problem:**

Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, one named `smaller`, the other named `larger`. 
If the user enters a smaller value for the second integer, 
use a block and a temporary variable to swap the smaller and larger values. 
Then print the values of the smaller and larger variables. 
Add comments to your code indicating where each variable dies. 
Note: When you print the values, `smaller` should hold the `smaller` input and `larger` the `larger` input, 
no matter which order they were entered in.

**Solution:**

Simple problem, get two numbers with inputs, then checking if they meet the condition of `smaller` < `larger`, 
if not, just swap them with a temporary variable.
